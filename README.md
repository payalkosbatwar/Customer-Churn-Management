# Predictive Analysis of Customer Churn Management

This project focuses on predictive analysis to determine customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on various features in the dataset.

## Project Overview
Dataset: Telecom Customer Churn Database
Objective: Predict customer churn using machine learning models.
Model Used: Logistic Regression

## Key Features
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python
Libraries:
  Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning
  NumPy for numerical computations
  Scikit-learn for machine learning and model evaluation

## Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Logistic Regression Model Training
5. Model Evaluation

## Results
The logistic regression model is used to predict customer churn with the given dataset, achieving reasonable accuracy through data preprocessing and model optimization.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook to explore the analysis:
